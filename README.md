This is the repo for my personal website. This site uses the following technologies:

- Flask
- Travis CI (for automatic deployment of site on push to app branch (master development branch))
- Javascript (for making AJAX calls to render code for Project Euler problems)
- Bootstrap (for CSS styling and grid system)
