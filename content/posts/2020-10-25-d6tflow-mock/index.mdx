## Intro to d6tflow

Recently I was introduced to the concept of data science pipelines.
In data science workflows (for machine learning, especially),
there are many different steps where data is transformed, cleaned, and prepared
for training. Stringing a sequence of functions can be very messy, and what if you
need to tweak your data just a bit? Will you have to go back through all of your
functions to change that one parameter?

If you are working with large datasets, it may also take some time to run all of the
code to clean your data from scratch. It would be nice to have a way to save intermediate
data and load it.

The d6tflow package offers the ability to take care of this for you. If you are familiar with the [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) project by Spotify
and are wondering how you might apply a similar workflow to data science, give d6tflow a try. Go check out the [d6tflow getting started guide](https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow/blob/master/docs/example-ml.md)
or take a look at the [documentation](https://d6tflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to get familiar with the package.
That is the end of my short plug for d6tflow. I will assume some basic knowledge of d6tflow for this article.

## What are Mocks?

A lot of times, when you are working with data science pipelines, you are going to have a lot of data. However, you don't
need all of that data to test the functionality of tasks in your d6tflow pipeline.

To see how mocks work in action, let's consider a concrete example. Say we want to
