<Card title="Problem 4 - Largest Palindrome Product">
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers
is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
</Card>

<EulerSolution>
Since there are only 900 3-digit numbers, checking all possibilities of products of 3 digit numbers gives <InlineMath math={`900^2 = 810,000`}/> possibilities. To eliminate redundancies, we can check only half (for example <InlineMath math={`100 \\cdot 200 = 200 \\cdot 100`} />).
This leaves 40,500 combinations to be checked. After multiplying each pair, we check to see if it is a palindrome and if
the number is greater than the current max palindrome.
