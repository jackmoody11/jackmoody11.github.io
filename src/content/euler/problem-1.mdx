<Card title="Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5">
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples
    of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 999.
</Card>

<EulerSolution>
Note that 3 divides 3, 6, 9, 12, ... and 5 divides 5, 10, ... while both numbers divide certain
numbers (15, 30, 45, ...). Since 3 and 5 are both prime numbers, they only "collide" every 15, so we can find the
sum of the numbers which are divisible by either 3 or 5 by summing the numbers divisible by either and then
subtracting the instances where we double count (every 15). Because we are only concerned with numbers below 999, we
will count to 999.

<BlockMath math={`
\\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor\\frac{999}{3}\\rfloor} 3i + \\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor\\frac{999}{5}\\rfloor} 5i -
    \\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor\\frac{999}{15}\\rfloor} 15i
`} />

Noting that this is simply an arithmetic sum, and the formula for an arithmetic sum of the form

<BlockMath math={`
    \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{n} = n\\left(\\frac{a_{1} + a_{n}}{2} \\right)
`} />

we can calculate the formula above.

<BlockMath math={`
\\text{Answer} = 333 \\left(\\frac{3 + 999}{2}\\right) + 199 \\left(\\frac{5 + 995}{2}\\right) - 66 \\left(\\frac{15 +
    990}{2}\\right)
`} />

<h5>Indirect Solution</h5>
One other possibility is to simply add all numbers that are divisible from 1 to 999 if they are divisible by 3 or 5.
This is what is done in the code below.
