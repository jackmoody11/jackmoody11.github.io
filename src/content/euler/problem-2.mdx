<Card title="Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers">
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
    first 10 terms will be:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p class="text-center">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
    even-valued terms.
</Card>

<EulerSolution>
Using the formula <BlockMath math={`
F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\text{ for } n \\geq 2
`} />
<BlockMath math={`
F_{0} = 1, F_{1} = 2
`} />

we simply
calculate each fibonacci up to (and possibly including) 4 million. For each fibonacci number, we add it to the total
if it is even.
