<Card title="Problem 3 - Largest Prime Factor">
  The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime
  factor of the number 600851475143?
</Card>

<EulerSolution>
  A number is said to be prime if the only natural numbers that divide itself
  are 1 and itself. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, every number has a
  unique representation as a product of primes (up to permutations of the prime
  products). Therefore, as long as 600,851,475,143 is not prime,
  <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63276/is-a-prime-factor-of-a-number-always-less-than-its-square-root">
    at least all but one of its prime divisors
  </a> must be less than <InlineMath math={`\\sqrt{600,851,475,143}`} />. That is,
  if we keep dividing the target of 600,851,475,143 by its prime divisors that are
  less than its square root, we will either get that the left over is greater than
  the max divisor we divided by and it is prime, or the max prime divisor found in
  the loop is the actual max divisor.
