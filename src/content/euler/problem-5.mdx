<Card title="Problem 5 - Smallest Multiple">
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is
the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
</Card>

<EulerSolution>
This is equivalent to the problem of finding the least common multiple of numbers from 1 to 20. Stated differently,
we are finding the least amount of times we need to include each prime in the prime factorization. For example,
<InlineMath math={`2^4 = 16`} /> is the most number of times we have a factor of 2. While 3 has a max power of 2 under 20, and all
primes greater than 3 have a maximum power of 1. Therefore, we multiply <InlineMath math={`2^4`} /> by <InlineMath math={`3^2`} /> and all of the other
primes greater than 3 but less than 20 to find the final answer.
