{% block problem_title %} Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5 {% endblock %}

{% block problem_text %}
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these
    multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 999.

    <h3>Direct Solution</h3>
    Note that 3 divides 3, 6, 9, 12, ... and 5 divides 5, 10, ... while both numbers divide certain
    numbers (15, 30, 45, ...). Since 3 and 5 are both prime numbers, they only "collide" every 15, so we can find the
    sum of the numbers which are divisible by either 3 or 5 by summing the numbers divisible by either and then
    subtracting the instances where we double count (every 15). Because we are only concerned with numbers below 999, we
    will count to 999.
    <br/>
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\rfloor} 3i + \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{999}{5}\rfloor} 5i -
    \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{999}{15}\rfloor} 15i
    \]
    <br/>
    Noting that this is simply an arithmetic sum, and the formula for an arithmetic sum of the form
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{n} = n\left(\frac{a_{1} + a_{n}}{2} \right)
    \]
    we can calculate the formula above.
    <br/>
    \[
    \text{Answer} = 333 \left(\frac{3 + 999}{2}\right) + 199 \left(\frac{5 + 995}{2}\right) - 66 \left(\frac{15 +
    990}{2}\right)
    \]

    <br/>
    <h3>Indirect Solution</h3>
    One other possibility is to simply add all numbers that are divisible from 1 to 999 if they are divisible by 3 or 5.
    This is what is done in the code below.
