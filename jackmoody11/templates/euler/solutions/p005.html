{% block problem_text %}
    2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is
    the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

    This is equivalent to the problem of finding the least common multiple of numbers from 1 to 20. Stated differently,
    we are finding the least amount of times we need to include each prime in the prime factorization. For example,
    \(2^4 = 16\) is the most number of times we have a factor of 2. While 3 has a max power of 2 under 20, and all
    primes greater than 3 have a maximum power of 1. Therefore, we multiple \(2^4\) by \(3^2\) and all of the other
    primes greater than 3 but less than 20 to find the final answer.
