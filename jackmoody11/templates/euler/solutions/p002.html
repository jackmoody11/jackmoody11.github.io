{% block problem_text %}
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
    first 10 terms will be:
    <br/>
    <p class="text-center">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
    even-valued terms.

    Using the formula \[F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 2, \quad F_{0} = 1, F_{1} = 2 \] we simply
    calculate each fibonacci up to (and possibly including) 4 million. For each fibonacci number, we add it to the total
    if it is even.
