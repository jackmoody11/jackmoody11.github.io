{% block idea_text %}
    A number is said to be prime if the only natural numbers that divide itself are 1 and itself. By the Fundamental
    Theorem of Arithmetic, every number has a unique representation as a product of primes (up to permutations of the
    prime products). Therefore, as long as 600,851,475,143 is not prime,
    <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63276/is-a-prime-factor-of-a-number-always-less-than-its-square-root">at
        least all but one of its prime divisors must be less than \(\sqrt{600,851,475,143}\)</a>. That is, if we keep
    dividing the target of 600,851,475,143 by its prime
    divisors
    that are less than its square root, we will either get that the left over is greater than the max divisor we divided
    by and it is prime, or the max prime divisor found in the loop is the actual max divisor.
